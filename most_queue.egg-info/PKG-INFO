# most_queue
Software package for calculation and simulation of queuing systems and networks

## Authors
- [xabarov](https://github.com/xabarov)

## Installation
Install most-queue with pip
```bash
  pip install most-queue

## DESCRIPTION OF THE SOFTWARE PACKAGE
Most_queue consists of two packages:
 - **.theory** contains programs that implement methods for calculating queuing theory models. 
 - **.sim** contains simulation programs.

## DESCRIPTION OF THE SOFTWARE PACKAGE
Most_queue consists of two packages:
 - **.theory** contains programs that implement methods for calculating queuing theory models. 
 - **.sim** contains simulation programs. 

### Package .theory
| #  | Pakage name | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| 1. | diff5dots  | Numerical calculation of the derivative of a function |
| 2.  | fj_calc | Numerical calculation of the initial moments of the random variables maximum distribution  | 
| 3.  | m_ph_n_prty | Numerical calculation of QS M/Ph/n with 2 classes and PR - priority. Based on the approximation of busy periods |
| 4.  | mg1_calc | Numerical calculation of QS M/G/1 |

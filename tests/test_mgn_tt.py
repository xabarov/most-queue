"""
Testing the Takahasi-Takami method for calculating an M/H2/n queue

When the coefficient of variation of service time is less than 1, 
the parameters of the approximating H2 distribution
are complex, which does not prevent obtaining meaningful results.

For verification, simulation is used.
